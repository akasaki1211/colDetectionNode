# colDetectionNode

Remaked with plugin-node of collision detection part (expression node) of [maya_expressionCollision](https://github.com/akasaki1211/maya_expressionCollision).  
A slight improvement in processing speed can be expected.  

> **Warning**  
> Internal Use ID (0x7c001, 0x7c002) is used.

## Nodes  
There are two types of nodes of: input as vectors (`colDetectionNode`) or input as matrices (`colDetectionMtxNode`). These outputs are the same.

On its own, `colDetectionNode` is faster, but `colDetectionMtxNode` may be faster as a result because it does not require decomposeMatrix, etc. ã€€

## Performance
The following is the processing time for a single node when one each of sphere, capsule, and infinitePlane Collider is used, Iterations : 3, GroundCol : On.

## Note  
* Processing order of collider type cannot be changed.  
* Too many colliders reduce accuracy.  
* Scale is not supported.
